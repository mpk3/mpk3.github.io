# NNs are 

One of cooler things about Neural Nets is that, as you advance, you learn to employ different architectures for specific kinds of tasks. In this way, neural network architectures are one of the most powerful tools a DL/ML/CL engineer can use. Learning the nuances of these tools is important for anyone interested in leveraging them to their full capabilities.

## A Story:

There was a period of time in my life where I worked as a carpenter for a hostel in Taiwan. The building had a full woodshop on the 4th floor with a table saw in the middle of the room. One day the owner came upstairs and found me using a circular saw when we remarked I should use the table saw because it was safer. I had been avoiding the table saw because typically these saws were a lot stronger than handheld versions. There are horror stories in every woodshop about pieces of wood basically impaling or seriously injuring woodworkers after it was kicked back by one of these 3000lbs behemoths. When I told him this, he showed me that the table saw was actually a homemade version, made from the same brand and model of the skil-saw I had in my hand. After that whenever I walked passed a construction site I would always notice the same setup. There would always be a strong piece of plywood screwed to two wood horses. Understanding how their tools worked, allowed these carpenters to create a better, more jobsite appropriate version of a different saw. In this same way, convolutional neural networks are being used for natural language processing. While recurrent architectures are generally used for NLP, CNNs have found recent success in a few domains. I recently employed a CNN for text classification and will continue to use these models exploring their benefits and pitfalls.
