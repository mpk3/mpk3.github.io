# New Website Coming Soon:
Lately I have been doing some web app development using both Flask and Django. Currently I am going through a TDD in Python course that uses Django.
This is currently a static website written with Jekyll but I would like to add some interactive materials that would incorporate some of the general application
development I have been working on.

- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
