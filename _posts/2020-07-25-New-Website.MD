# New Website Coming Soon:
Lately I have been doing some web app development using both Django and Flask. In order to incorporate some of this into my personal website I have
decided to switch to one of those frameworks after I finish one of my current projects. This website is currently written using Jekyll.

- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
