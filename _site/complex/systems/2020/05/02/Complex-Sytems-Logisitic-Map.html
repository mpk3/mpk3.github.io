<p>Currently I am reading Melanie Mitchell’s wonderful book <em>Complexity: A Guided Tour</em>. Growing up and even today I have had a fascination with ants and hymenoptera in general. When I was studying linguistics I was introduced to language being viewed as a complex adaptive system. Both language and formicae behavior can be studied under the lense of complex systems so naturally I found the subject quite compelling. In the second chapter Mitchell introduces the reader to the logistic map equation. This equation has been used by biologists to examine population dynamics but also is a great example of chaos theory, specifically the sensitive dependence on initial conditions. In popular culture this is often referred to as the <strong>Butterfly Effect</strong></p>

<h3 id="equation">Equation:</h3>
<p>The logistic map equation is quite simple in appearance which is one of the reasons it is so appealing to study:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/logistic_map.svg" alt="Logistic Map" /></p>

<p>There are a lot of interesting qualities about this equation and its behavior is well documented on the wikipedia page. For instance when r is in the interval (0,1) the population decreases until its eventual demise. However, when r is in the interval (1,2), the population will eventually reach (r-1)/r regardless of the initial population. When r &gt; 3 the population oscillates in different ways. It is when r reaches ~3.56995 that  <em>chaos</em> sets it. The behavior of this equation is far more nuanced than my explanation but rather than copying from my sources verbatim I am going to use this as oppurtunity to do some basic plotting to show the behavior of this equation visually.</p>

<p>In this first plot we can see the behavior when R is bound 0 =&lt; R =&lt; 4. This plot is done with 20 iterations showing that regardless of the value of x the result of the logistic map converges on the same value. It can be seen however that when R is appraoches 3 the value starts to oscillate and at ~3.56995 the behavior changes drammatically.</p>

<p>If you zoom in on these values there starts to emerge a discernible pattern. At certain values of R the result oscillates between 2, 4, 8, 16 etc. different results
<img src="/assets/lm_2.png" alt="Logistic Map 2" />
And as you can see when the equation reaches ~3.56995 the behavior changes dramatically. While this behavior is deemed as <em>chaotic</em> there are patterns within it. As a young man, like Laplace, I imagined that if we could measure the world accurately enough the laws of physics would allow us to predict to the future akin to watching dominoes fall. This chaotic behavior demonstrates one of the reasons why this may not be the case.
