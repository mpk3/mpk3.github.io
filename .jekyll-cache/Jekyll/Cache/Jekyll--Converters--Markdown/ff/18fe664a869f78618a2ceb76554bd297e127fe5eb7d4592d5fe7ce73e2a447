<p>So what follows is the beginning of a series of posts I will be making while going through Sheldon Ross’s <em>Introduction to Probability Models 10ed.</em>.
Now that I have graduated I have a little more time to dedicate to topics that I find interesting. One of the topics I find most interesting is math, particularly probability, statistics, and how they can be used to model language. A lot of Ross’s book will be a review for me so I am hoping to hammer out some of the finer details that I may have missed when I first started studying probability.</p>
