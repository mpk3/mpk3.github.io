<p>While some of these challenges are just different iterations on common algorithms, I have found this particularly useful for testing out how I would solve these problems in different programming languages. For the most part these algorithms can be implemented in the same way across languages outside obvious language particular features. One of the cool things about this though is that sometimes you can gleam really interesting ways of tackling problems. I will be completing the entire 30 day challenge and use this series of blog posts to highlight some of the more interesting techniques. I will be completing the challenge in both python and c++. For python I am mostly looking at writing code in the most pythonic way I can. For c++ the focus will be on understanding the changes in speed and memory allocation across implementations.</p>
