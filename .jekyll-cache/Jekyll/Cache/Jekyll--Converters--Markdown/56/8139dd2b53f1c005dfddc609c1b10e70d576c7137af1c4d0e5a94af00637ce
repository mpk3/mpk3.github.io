<p>Currently I am reading Melanie Mitchellâ€™s wonderful book <em>Complexity: A Guided Tour</em>. Growing up and even today I have had a fascination with ants and hymenoptera in general. When I was studying linguistics I was introduced to language being viewed as a complex adaptive system. Both language and formicae behavior can be studied under the lense of complex systems so naturally I found the subject quite compelling. In the second chapter Mitchell introduces the reader to the logistic map equation. This equation has been used by biologists to examine population dynamics but also is a great example of chaos theory, specifically the sensitive dependence on initial conditions. In popular culture this is often referred to as the <strong>Butterfly Effect</strong></p>
